    time: 'May 2019',
    content: `In 2019, I embarked on a thrilling odyssey into the realm of computers,
	  guided by the tech maestro, Mr. James Walker. As I took my first tentative
	  steps into the binary universe, little did I know that this encounter
	  would spark a passionate affair with the world of circuits and code.
	  <br />
	  Picture this: the soft hum of the computer, the glow of the screen casting
	  a futuristic aura. Mr. Walker, a digital wizard in his own right, became
	  my mentor in this techno-epic. With each keystroke, I unearthed the
	  secrets of algorithms and the magic behind software. <br />
	  And so, my love story with computers unfoldedâ€”a tale woven with lines of
	  code, punctuated by the exhilaration of breakthroughs, and colored by the
	  vibrant pixels of endless possibilities. Little did I realize that my
	  first encounter with that machine would mark the inception of a lifelong
	  romance with the ever-evolving world of technology.`,

    subtitle: 'Digitization of Tibetan Manuscript',
    time: 'June 2020 - March 2022',
    content: `Fast forward to the summer of 2020, where my journey led me to
	  the Tibetan Library of Works & Archives (LTWA). Submerged in the
	  profound history of ancient Tibetan Buddhist manuscripts, I
	  embraced the responsibility of not just preserving the past, but
	  catapulting it into the digital future. <br />
	  My task? Weaving a virtual tapestry of knowledge by crafting a
	  website that housed the treasures of centuries past. As I delved
	  into the intricate details of each manuscript, it wasn't just
	  about coding; it was a dance with the echoes of ancient wisdom.
	  <br />
	  From the rhythmic strokes of the keyboard emerged a digital
	  sanctuary for these timeless manuscripts. As the caretaker of
	  this virtual repository, my days were a symphony of code and
	  contemplation, ensuring that the essence of Tibetan heritage was
	  not only preserved but also made accessible to a global
	  audience.
	  <br />
	  For almost two years, I rode the waves of technology and
	  tradition, bridging ancient wisdom with modern connectivity.
	  Little did I know that my keyboard would become a brush,
	  painting the canvas of the digital Tibetan landscape.`,

	  <a href="https://covid.tibet.dev"> ðŸ‘‰ </a>`,
    time: '2022',
    content: `Amid the chaotic waves of the pandemic, when COVID data in
	  Tibetan felt like a distant mirage, I decided it was time to
	  create a digital oasis. Armed with React and fueled by a
	  determination to keep my fellow Tibetans informed, I embarked on
	  a coding quest.
	  <br />
	  Picture this: in the midst of global uncertainty, lines of code
	  became my warrior's brush, and the virtual canvas my
	  battleground. With every keystroke, I conjured a website that
	  wasn't just about data; it was a lifeline, a connection to vital
	  information in our own language.
	  <br />
	  As the pixels danced on the screen, a beacon of hope emergedâ€”a
	  React-powered sanctuary where my community could navigate the
	  labyrinth of pandemic statistics. No longer confined by the
	  language barrier, my fellow Tibetans could now access COVID
	  insights with ease.
	  <br />
	  In the heart of adversity, I transformed isolation into
	  innovation, turning my coding prowess into a force for
	  connection and empowerment. The website became more than a
	  digital tool; it became a testament to resilience, a spark of
	  light in the midst of a global storm.`,

    time: 'Nov 2022 - Present',
    content: `Arriving in the Netherlands on the vibrant King's Day ðŸ¥³ of
	  April 27, 2022, marked the beginning of a new chapter in my
	  life. Eager to immerse myself in the rich Dutch culture, I
	  embarked on a linguistic journey at the Hoogeschool van
	  Amsterdam (HvA). Learning Dutch wasn't just about mastering a
	  language; it was a key to unlocking the doors of integration.
	  <br />
	  In just one whirlwind year, I raced through the linguistic
	  landscape, conquering the B1 level with the wind at my back.
	  Yet, the quest continues as I delve into the intricacies of B2,
	  navigating the linguistic canals and tulip fields of Dutch
	  proficiency.
	  <br />
	  Beyond conjugations and vocabulary, my goal extends to more than
	  language proficiency. It's about weaving myself into the vibrant
	  tapestry of Dutch society. Each Dutch phrase I master becomes a
	  bridge to connection, and every grammatical conquest is a step
	  closer to becoming a part of the daily rhythm of life in the Low
	  Countries.
	  <br />
	  As I study for B2, I eagerly anticipate the day when I'll
	  seamlessly blend into Dutch society, not just as a speaker of
	  the language, but as a participant in the colorful mosaic of
	  Dutch life.`,

    content: `While mastering Dutch, I embarked on a parallel missionâ€”to
	  fortify the digital presence of our Tibetan community in the
	  Netherlands. Armed with coding prowess and a passion for
	  community, I became the architect of our online space.
	  <br />
	  Juggling Dutch grammar and web development became my daily
	  symphony. The pixels on the screen weren't just characters; they
	  were threads weaving a tapestry that connected our community in
	  the digital realm. As I navigated the intricacies of Dutch
	  syntax, I also navigated the intricacies of creating an online
	  home for my fellow Tibetans.
	  <br />
	  Managing digital assets became more than a task; it became a way
	  to preserve our cultural identity in the vast landscape of the
	  internet. From coding lines to content curation, every effort
	  was a gesture of unity, a digital handshake among our community
	  members.
	  <br />
	  In this parallel journey of language and digital stewardship, I
	  found that building bridgesâ€”whether linguistic or virtualâ€”was
	  the true essence of community. As I strived for linguistic
	  fluency, I also aimed for a fluent connection between our
	  Tibetan roots and our digital future in the Netherlands.`,
